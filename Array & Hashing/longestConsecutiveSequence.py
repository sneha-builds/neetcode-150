#Array and Hashing: Longest Consecutive Sequence

"""
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.
A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
