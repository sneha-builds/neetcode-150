# Search In Rotated Sorted Array

"""

You are given an array of length n which was originally sorted in ascending order. It has now been rotated
between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums=[1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:

[3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times
[1,2,3,4,5,6] of ot was rotated 6 times.

Given the rotated sorted array nums and an integer, return the index of target within nums, or -1 if it is not present.

You may assume all elements in the sorted rotated array nums are unique,
A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?
