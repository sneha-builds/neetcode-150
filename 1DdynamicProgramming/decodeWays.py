# Decode Ways

"""

A string consisting of uppercase english characters can be encoded to a number using the following mapping:
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"

To decode a message, digits must be grouped and then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above.
There may be multiple ways to decode a message.For example. "1012" can be mapped into:

  . "JAB" with the grouping (10 1 2)
  . "JL" with the grouping (10 12)

The grouping (10 1 2) is invalid because 01 cannot be mapped into a letter since it contains a leading zero.
Given a string s containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. You cam assume that the answer
fits in 32-bit integer.

Constraints:
  . 1<=s.length<=100
  . s consists of digits
