# K Closest Points To Origin

"""
You are given an 2-D array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of a point on an X-Y axis plane. You are also given an integer k.

Return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points is defined as the Euclidean distance (sqrt((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)).

You may return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

  . 1 <= k <= points.length <= 1000
  . -100 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 100
